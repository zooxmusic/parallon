### Parallon Coding Challenge

##### To avoid taking longer than I already have I am aware that I DID NOT
* Write unit tests
* Write integration tests of which I would use JBehave/Sonar
* Write a checkstyle / lint
* I chose NOT to use lombok for ease of running
* I did use the gradle wrapper for ease of use (i.e. ./gradlew)
* I would create        custom login, error and 404 pages
* I am would have currently used more of an Event Sourced methodology but felt this was my best bet given the time I lost due to computer issues as well as other personal issues
